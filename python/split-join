If I had a list and I wanted to turn it into a string by combining each value together with a specified separator.
What method would I use?  
# join. it is on string


I saw a pretty great shirt today.
If I had that text in a string like so:
text = "Ada&Jean&Grace&Margaret"
What code could I use to convert it to a list?
# text.split('&')
